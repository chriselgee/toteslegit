# Go Pentest Yourself!

This repository covers instructions for completing basic penetration testing on your own environment.
While this is not a recommended replacement for quality, third-party pentesting, it's a great first step.
Also, if you knock this out before your pentesters arrive, that'll force them to work harder and find deeper vulnerabilities!
